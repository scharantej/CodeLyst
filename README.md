## Flask Application Design: Learn C Code for Students

### HTML Files

#### 1. ```index.html```

- Home page where students can access different resources for learning C code.
- Includes links to C tutorials, exercises, and a forum for discussion.

#### 2. ```tutorials.html```

- Contains a list of C tutorials organized by topic.
- Each tutorial includes a brief description and a link to the full tutorial.

#### 3. ```exercises.html```

- Presents a collection of C exercises of varying difficulty levels.
- Each exercise includes a description and a link to the solution.

#### 4. ```forum.html```

- Provides a platform for students to ask questions, share knowledge, and discuss C-related topics.
- Includes separate sections for beginners, intermediate, and advanced learners.

### Routes

#### 1. ```@app.route('/')```

- Connects to the ```index.html``` file.
- Serves as the landing page for the application.

#### 2. ```@app.route('/tutorials')```

- Connects to the ```tutorials.html``` file.
- Displays the list of C tutorials.

#### 3. ```@app.route('/exercises')```

- Connects to the ```exercises.html``` file.
- Presents the collection of C exercises.

#### 4. ```@app.route('/forum')```

- Connects to the ```forum.html``` file.
- Provides access to the discussion forum.

#### 5. ```@app.route('/tutorial/<topic>')```

- Connects to a specific tutorial based on the provided ```topic``` parameter.
- Displays the full tutorial content.

#### 6. ```@app.route('/exercise/<id>')```

- Connects to a specific exercise based on the ```id``` parameter.
- Shows the exercise description and provides a link to the solution.

#### 7. ```@app.route('/forum/<section>')```

- Connects to a specific section of the forum based on the ```section``` parameter.
- Displays the relevant discussions and allows users to post new questions or replies.

### Additional Notes

- The HTML files should be placed in a ```templates``` folder within the application directory.
- The routes should be defined in a ```routes.py``` file, which is then imported into the main Flask application file.
- Consider incorporating a database to store user information, questions, and responses for the forum section.
- For styling and interactivity, incorporate CSS and JavaScript files as needed.

This Flask application design provides a comprehensive platform for students to learn C code effectively. It offers a structured and organized way to access tutorials, exercises, and a discussion forum, fostering a collaborative learning environment.
